## Stage 2 - Automation configuration
In this Stage we will configure the MISP platform to bring in cyber threat intelligence and prepare it for export. We will also deploy all necessary services for the automation of edge protection and processing of cyber threat intelligence. We'll go over the solutions architecture first, deployment instructions are below it.
